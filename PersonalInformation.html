        <h2>Redberry Origins </h2>
        <p>You watch “What? Where? When?” Yeah. Our <br> founders used to play it. That’s where they got a <br> question about a famous American author and <br> screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga <br> Darsalia forgot the exact name and he answered Ray <br> Redberry. And at that moment, a name for a yet to be <br> born company was inspired - Redberry 😇</p>
